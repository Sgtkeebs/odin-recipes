        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This particular recipe is an Asian-inspired version of the infamous cheese steak. Thinly sliced steak is cooked with delicious onions (mmmmmm), cheese spread, and a splash of teriyaki sauce, served on sandwich rolls. You could literally have a full course meal with just the bread.</p>
