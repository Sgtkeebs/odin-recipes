        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Whisk together eggs, milk, and salt in a large bowl. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in egg mixture; cook and stir until eggs are completely set, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Break up cooked eggs into small pieces and place into a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the same large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage and garlic in the hot skillet for 5 minutes, Add onion; continue to cook and stir until sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>
            <li>Transfer sausage to eggs in the bowl. Stir in tomato, cilantro, jalape√±os, and taco seasoning until well combined. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature, then stir in Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Lay a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon some of the egg filling halfway between the bottom edge and the center of tortilla. Flatten filling into a rectangular shape with the back of a spoon. Fold the bottom of tortilla snugly over filling, then fold in the left and right edges. Roll burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wrap individual burritos tightly with plastic wrap and store in the freezer until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>To serve, heat burritos in the microwave until hot, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
